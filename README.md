"Snake Game - My First Basic Java Project" üéÆüêç

This Snake Game is my first project in Java, created with the Swing library to bring the classic arcade experience to life! In the game, you control a snake that grows longer each time it eats randomly placed food on the board. The challenge is to avoid crashing into the walls or the snake‚Äôs own body!

The project uses various coding techniques to build the game:

Java Swing for GUI components, creating the game window and handling graphics.
JPanel for drawing game elements, such as the snake, food, and grid lines.
Event Handling to capture and respond to arrow key inputs, allowing smooth snake movement.
Timer and ActionListener for the game loop, updating the snake's position and checking for collisions.
Random Class for placing food tiles at random positions on the board.
Collision Detection to end the game when the snake hits a wall or its own body.
With simple key controls, real-time updates, and a score display, this project showcases the basics of Java programming and game logic. It was a fun introduction to building interactive applications!
